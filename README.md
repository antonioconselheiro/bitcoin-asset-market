> ² E clamou fortemente com grande voz, dizendo: Caiu, caiu a grande Babilônia, e se tornou morada de demônios, e coito de todo espírito imundo, e coito de toda ave imunda e odiável. ³ Porque todas as nações beberam do vinho da ira da sua fornicação, e os reis da terra fornicaram com ela; e os mercadores da terra se enriqueceram com a abundância de suas delícias. ⁴ E ouvi outra voz do céu, que dizia: Sai dela, povo meu, para que não sejas participante dos seus pecados, e para que não incorras nas suas pragas. 

# Bitcoin Asset Market

## Need:
being able to buy and sell a percentage of a digital asset/product that is capitalized in bitcoin. To do this, you will need to:

- there are ways to link a bitcoin wallet to a digital product so that they become inseparable;
- there is a way to transfer the funds received in the product's wallet to other associated wallets, in an automated way;
- ensure that my percentage of ownership of the product is self-custodial so that only those who have its keys can share it to sell its fragments and also decide which wallet those funds will be directed to.

## With this we will have:
Assets capitalized in bitcoin being segmentable with guarantees that the property's down payment percentage will be passed on to the owner in an irreversible manner.

It becomes possible to start digital products by guaranteeing the technicians involved their share in the undertaking of that digital service.

This allows the owner of the asset to sell parts of it to investors, for the amount that in one or two years the percentage of the asset would raise in bitcoin.

## Any idea?
